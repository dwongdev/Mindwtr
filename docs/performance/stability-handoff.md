# Performance and stability handoff

Updated September 12, 2026. Engineering handoff for future desktop and mobile
sessions, not a claim that the performance audit is complete.

Implementation baseline: `3d67289a9` on `perf/native-contention`, plus this
documentation commit. This handoff is intended to travel with the merge to
`main`. At the next session, inspect current Git/CI state; this document does not
certify a later commit, release, or deployment.

## Start here

1. Read this handoff, then the relevant investigation linked below. Historical
   reports retain their original findings; later reports can supersede an old
   report's “next step.” Do not restart completed or rejected experiments.
2. Read [Performance baselines](baselines.md) for runner commands,
   readiness/identity contracts, isolation, and artifact formats, and
   [Performance budgets](budgets.md) for the existing CI thresholds.
3. Pick one measurable hypothesis on one platform, establish a current control,
   add a failing correctness/work-count regression, and make a bounded change.
   Keep desktop and mobile as separate tracks; shared-core microbenchmarks do
   not replace native validation on either.
4. Preserve raw successes and failures, validate correctness before timings,
   and commit each accepted fix with its evidence. Check current authorization
   before merging/pushing; this handoff is not ongoing publication permission.

## Completed changes and strength of evidence

September12 review addendum: iOS widget publication now performs one full
selection pass instead of six, with448 byte-identical old-source comparisons.
See [widget publication derivation](widget-publication-2026-09.md), Plan084.
Native iOS latency and WidgetKit rendering remain unmeasured; prior platform
work and open hypotheses below are unchanged.

The figures below are historical observations under each report's conditions,
not universal performance promises. Follow the links for raw samples, build
hashes, fixture sizes, safety tests, and limitations.

| Area | Implemented / established | Evidence and limits |
|---|---|---|
| Startup and loading | Canonical-data and interactive-readiness markers, production-browser runner, Android launch classification, phase separation | [Baseline contracts](baselines.md#readiness-contract). Shell/splash timing is not usable-app readiness; deep-link starts are not covered by the main-screen marker. |
| Desktop Settings | Transitions preserve visible content while lazy routes/sections load; General co-loads with Settings, other sections remain lazy | [Settings investigation](desktop-settings-2026-09.md). First Integrations medians about 412 → 158 ms; General improved strongly at 0/1k tasks, not consistently at 10k. Browser/automation timings, not native keyring or all-OS results. |
| Shared full merge | Avoid spreading normalized task winners when attachment reconciliation leaves their attachment reference unchanged | [Merge allocation](merge-allocation-2026-09.md). Paired 10k-task Bun median CPU fell about 27–31%, corroborated in Node; 420 pairs retained equal data/statistics. Not a measured phone/full-network sync speedup. |
| Native desktop snapshot writes | Reuse prepared INSERT statements without changing transaction or snapshot semantics | [Statement reuse](native-snapshot-save-2026-09.md). Isolated 10k-task save median 2461 → 1901 ms, three samples per mode. The experimental one-second target was not met by this change. |
| Native desktop capture persistence | Append only new tasks when the canonical result preserves all existing tasks and other entities/settings exactly; otherwise retain full replacement | [Append-only path](native-append-capture-2026-09.md). Isolated save median 1792 → 465 ms; small native A/B/B/A readback median 2532 → 1081 ms. Not a general differential writer; visibility did not initially improve. |
| Desktop pre-save preparation | Structurally equal cloned snapshots skip fingerprint preparation, with the old fingerprint rule retained as mismatch fallback | [Baseline equality](storage-baseline-equality-2026-09.md), `552707a59`. Isolated 10k-task median 34.03 → 5.05 ms; deterministic zero-serialization and compatibility tests. Intermittent slow visible captures remained. |
| Shared serialization / desktop self-write tracking | Reuse at most eight property-name layouts within a traversal; read values fresh and retain identical canonical bytes | [Property ordering](watcher-property-order-2026-09.md), `e744235c4`. Watcher regression 503 sorts → fewer than ten; isolated median 9.89 → 8.56 ms. No deferred snapshot or cross-call cache. |
| Mobile quick-capture rendering | Stabilize the context value when its action callback is unchanged; propagate changed actions/options normally | [Capture context](capture-context-2026-09.md), `3d67289a9`. Regression reduces three consumer renders to one. All 20 phone keyboard checks and three sampled capture iterations passed; overall latency improvement is not established. |

## Measurement and stability safeguards added

- Native desktop capture checks canonical readiness, then actual save-queue
  quiescence rather than an arbitrary sleep. Independent SQLite readback,
  exactly-once capture, and reload survival remain required. See
  [save-idle boundaries](native-save-idle-2026-09.md).
- The in-page render probe separates DOM appearance from WebDriver overhead;
  opt-in JSC sampling locates pre-frame work. See
  [append visibility follow-up](native-append-capture-2026-09.md#capture-visibility-follow-up)
  and [native capture sampling](native-capture-sampling-2026-09.md).
- On this dual-monitor niri workstation, `NATIVE_VIEWPORT=1200x800@2` targets
  only the verified Benchmark executable's window. Requested/actual dimensions,
  scale, and transient resizes are checked; other windows/display settings are
  untouched. [Fixed-viewport A/B/B/A](fixed-viewport-2026-09.md),
  `e96858a3c`, completed the previously invalid property-order comparison:
  Enter-to-DOM 142 → 139.5 ms (essentially unchanged), independent readback
  1004.3 → 927.3 ms (descriptive, six observations per build).
- Android capture benchmarks require **visible IME**, not just input focus:
  ten cold launches plus ten warm opens must pass before timing. App and runner
  hashes are checked before and after the batch. See
  [keyboard acceptance](capture-focus-2026-09.md#automatic-acceptance-gate-and-rendering-follow-up)
  and [identity checks](mobile-navigation-2026-09.md#benchmark-identity-fix).
- Profiling flags now version Metro transforms and are Gradle bundle-task
  inputs (`131ca1276`). Native sampler presence alone was insufficient: stale
  JS contained a no-op start function. Require a fresh nonempty profile after
  one manual capture before a long batch. See
  [profiling-cache isolation](profiling-cache-2026-09.md).
- Synthetic restart/endurance tests cover pre-commit termination, injected write
  errors, post-ack termination, stale snapshots, three-peer convergence, and
  lost remote acknowledgements. A 100-round run passed 600 cycle samples during
  the merge investigation. This is not hardware power-loss, actual disk-full,
  real cloud concurrency, or native background recovery evidence. See
  [reliability boundaries](baselines.md#restart-recovery-and-sync-endurance).

## Findings that remain open

- **Android capture:** native modal creation/layout, window add/relayout/removal,
  and occasional system-server contention still contribute to missed frames.
  React/Fabric/GC work also precedes opening. The latest context candidate's
  sampled frame-overrun p95 was +7.03 ms versus +7.13 ms control, but its worst
  overrun was higher (+16.85 versus +14.30 ms). Small non-interleaved sampling
  batches do not establish an overall speedup or regression.
- **Desktop capture:** deterministic preparation costs are reduced, but rare
  long Enter-to-DOM samples and roughly one-second automation-inclusive durable
  readback at 10k tasks still need current, phase-separated profiling. Earlier
  large visibility differences did not consistently reproduce. Do not attribute
  all readback time to SQL or assume all rendering delays are fixed.
- **Scrolling and Settings on Android:** 1k-task native baselines exist, with
  occasional view-creation/mounting costs. They do not establish 10k-task,
  sustained allocation/memory, General-subpage, or sync-contention performance.
  See [mobile navigation](mobile-navigation-2026-09.md) and the later
  [native scrolling baseline](native-interactions-2026-09.md#android-scrolling).
- **Full sync:** host merge CPU improvements are proven within their test scope.
  Native merge/bridge time, encryption, network, attachment transfer, peak memory,
  and concurrent editing still need separate measurements.

## Prioritized next sessions

These are proposed work items, not completed checks or authorization to access
personal data, accounts, or additional hardware.

### P1 — Matched native interaction measurements on both platforms

**Android:** build sampling-disabled control/candidate Benchmark APKs from exact
sources with identical dependencies. Keep startup/compilation settings identical;
archive each APK and verify installed hashes. Use matched fixtures and an
interleaved A/B/B/A protocol after the 20-check IME gate. Retain per-iteration
frames, thermal/refresh conditions, and failures. Collect separate sampled traces
only for attribution. Do not introduce a p95 gate from three interactions or
equate pooled frame percentiles with input latency. If reporting input-to-visible
latency, first define and validate an appropriate native presentation boundary.

**Desktop:** use fresh isolated portable profiles, fixed viewport, and idle-save
boundaries with the same archived binaries across A/B/B/A. Reproduce a slow
10k-task capture with the in-page probe and separately sample JSC/native phases.
Distinguish event handling, DOM/paint opportunity, preparation, IPC, native
transaction, recovery JSON, and independent readback. Change only the dominant
reproducible cost; extend the existing differential tests before touching writes.

Acceptance: complete comparable reports, no input/keyboard regression, exact-once
creation, durable readback and reload survival, and no weakened correctness gates.
An inconclusive result is a valid outcome; retain it and avoid speculative fixes.

### P1 — Save and edit responsiveness during real sync

Use explicitly authorized test backends/accounts and synthetic peers. Measure
desktop and phone capture, typing, task completion, and navigation during a large
merge and attachment transfer. Separate network/encryption/merge/storage/UI phases
and record peak memory. Test retry/lost acknowledgement, conflict with pending
local edits, deletion/tombstone convergence, and cancellation/backgrounding.

Acceptance: no lost or duplicate acknowledged captures, no overwritten edits or
resurrected deletions, convergence after retry/restart, phase timings from native
runtimes, and a bounded fix with a regression if a bottleneck is reproduced.
Host file-remote endurance does not complete this item.

### P2 — Large lists, cold loading, and memory

Cover desktop and phone 1k/10k fixtures, repeated navigation/scroll/edit cycles,
mounted-row bounds, offscreen work, GC/allocations, and retained memory after
returning idle. Measure cold canonical reads/migrations separately from warm
loading and IPC transfer. Profile native Settings configuration/keyring reads on
appropriate test profiles; portable Linux mode bypasses the OS keyring.

Acceptance: stable virtualization and selection/edit state, no sustained growth
across repeated cycles, complete readiness without backup-only/error/locked false
positives, and measured before/after evidence for any optimization.

### P2 — Native reliability and remaining platforms

Test capture queue replay after process termination (including native widget/
intent capture), interrupted attachments, old-version database upgrades, backup
restore, and real disk-full handling on disposable isolated storage. Preserve
SQLite/WAL durability, rollback, FTS/FK integrity, revision/CAS arbitration,
observed-ID/restore protections, and recovery-copy semantics.

Add native macOS and Windows baselines, and iOS/device coverage when hardware and
authorization are available. Linux/Chromium measurements and platform compilation
are not substitutes. Do not claim these checks have already been done.

### P3 — Sustainable regression tracking

Maintain an idle-device/native-host trend series with enough comparable batches
to estimate normal variance before choosing latency/tail thresholds. Keep CI
work-count/integrity assertions strict and hosted timing reports descriptive.
Archive exact source/build/map identities and failed runs. Record the terminal
status of exact CI runs; do not call a running workflow green.

## Rejected experiments and traps

- Immediate `onShow` focus and next-frame focus failed cold keyboard readiness;
  focused text input did not mean the IME served it. Keep the restored 120 ms
  path unless a new proposal passes the full native gate.
- Activity-local capture presentation passed correctness after inset fixes but
  worsened the comparison's frame metrics. It was **not promoted**. Read the
  [focus experiment](capture-focus-2026-09.md) before revisiting it.
- Co-loading General Settings alone did not reliably solve first-open delay;
  the accepted change also uses the route transition.
- Cloning/deferred watcher serialization was rejected as slower in the probe
  and as requiring additional snapshot/queue safety. Current reuse caches only
  field-name order within one traversal, never mutable payloads across calls.
- Never pool portrait/landscape or changing-scale runs, early-session/idle-save
  scenarios, sampled/unsampled builds, or differently sized capture-grown stores.
- Old Hermes files survive APK replacement. Pair fresh profiles with the exact
  APK's map. Root-only samples are not automatically idle time; verify scheduler
  evidence. Incomplete overlapping thread-state intervals can corrupt frame CPU
  attribution; validate interval coverage before using a span join.
- Do not add help banners or question-mark controls to main pages during
  performance/discoverability work. Keep existing task/project detail help and
  user-dismissable first-use guidance; no distracting main-page UI.

## Current local lab state and evidence

At the last device session (not a promise of current state), only the separate
Android Benchmark app was tested. Its synthetic Inbox contained 234 tasks;
`mixed-v1-1000-cbfcca2e13cf76a5-plus34captures` is an operator label, not a newly
exported full-content hash. Sync was Off. The normal app was untouched. The
uninstrumented control APK was restored, hash checked, freshly launched to
confirm the Inbox, then force-stopped. Reconfirm device availability, package,
data, sync, thermal/refresh state, and identity before every new experiment.

Local evidence lives under `/home/dd/.cache/mindwtr-performance-tmp/`, especially
`native-contention/`, `capture-storage-followup/`, `settings-first-open/`, and
`mindwtr-perfetto/`. Exact run directories/hashes are in the linked reports.
APKs, native executables, maps, traces, screenshots and synthetic databases are
local artifacts, not committed or guaranteed to survive cleanup. If missing,
rebuild and establish a fresh baseline; do not invent continuity from filenames.

Use isolated worktrees under `/home/dd/worktrees/Mindwtr/<task>`. Keep dependencies,
builds and `TMPDIR`/`BUN_TMPDIR` on disk under `/home/dd`, not `/tmp` or `/dev/shm`.
Preserve other work and do not reuse another session's device/window without
checking ownership. No builds/tests may overlap measured batches. No normal-app
uninstall, data clear, personal database import, or global monitor/radio changes.

## Commands and CI map

Run from the intended checkout; set disk-backed output/temp paths before large
experiments. Full invocation and safety requirements remain in
[Performance baselines](baselines.md), not duplicated here.

```bash
rtk bun run test:perf
rtk bun run test:perf-tools
rtk bun run test:reliability
rtk bun run perf:web
rtk bun run perf:storage
rtk bun run perf:native
rtk bun run perf:android-interactions
```

The runners requiring explicit device, synthetic-data or binary identity
configuration must not be run with guessed values. Run relevant correctness,
typecheck/lint, native tests, and diagnostic-ledger tests for the changed path.

- [CI](../../.github/workflows/ci.yml): push/PR unit checks, cross-platform performance
  budgets and benchmark harness regressions.
- [Performance Baselines](../../.github/workflows/performance-baselines.yml): weekly
  Monday/manual, sequential production-browser/storage/reliability reports and
  Android runner compilation; **no physical-phone measurements**. It does not
  automatically run on every push. Artifacts currently retain for 90 days.
- [Native Platform CI](../../.github/workflows/native-platform-ci.yml): path-filtered
  native checks; compile/test success is not a native performance benchmark.
- [Diagnostics ledger](../release-notes/diagnostics-ledger.md): authoritative
  release markers and what they prove. Hidden/complicated production fixes need
  a privacy-safe marker and sanitizer test as required by `AGENTS.md`; do not
  infer durable saves or speed from a marker that only proves a path ran.

## Suggested skills and next-session reporting

The project-local `$mindwtr-performance-loop` skill follows this measurement,
correctness, fix, validation and handoff cycle. In this lab it is exposed through
Mindwtr's `.codex/skills/` link; its maintained source is in the private
`mindwtr-agent` repository, not the public app tree. A standalone clone can follow
this handoff and the public baseline guide without that private skill.

Use `diagnosing-bugs` for one reproducible bottleneck; `perfetto-trace-analysis`
and `android-emulator-testing` for device work; `mindwtr-design-guardrails` before
any persistence/sync/status/settings change; `sync-device-testing` for authorized
real-backend acceptance. Use `apple-design` / `ui-ux-pro-max` if a measured fix
changes interaction or layout. Follow the active session's delegation rules;
this handoff does not authorize subagents.

After each session, update this index with the new source commit, evidence link,
accepted/rejected result, exact validation and CI status, remaining limitations,
next bounded hypothesis, and restored device/window state. Keep detailed raw
measurements in a dated report rather than accumulating them here. A successful
microbenchmark, passing build, and completed platform audit are different claims.
