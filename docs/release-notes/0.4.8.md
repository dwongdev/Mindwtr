# Mindwtr 0.4.8

## Highlights
- F‑Droid/IzzyOnDroid prep: added FOSS build scripts and updated the recipe for clean, unsigned builds.
- Projects: drag‑and‑drop reordering for areas and projects (desktop + mobile).
- Mobile: area color picker is always visible in the Area Manager and colors propagate to projects/tasks.

## Details
- Added FOSS build prep scripts (`fdroid_prep.sh`, `fdroid_strip_deps.js`) to remove non‑FOSS deps for source builds.
- Android build script now supports `UNSIGNED_APK=1` for builder‑side signing.
- Mobile project edit now scrolls properly; task list inside the modal no longer steals scroll.
- Core: project order persisted in SQLite + store migration to support reorder.
