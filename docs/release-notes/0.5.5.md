# Mindwtr 0.5.5

## Highlights
- Release stability fixes: resolve Linux white-screen regressions and improve diagnostics for release builds.
- SQLite startup fixes: safe project order indexing and contentless FTS trigger migrations.
- Sync + setup polish: default sync backend off until configured and improved Winget release metadata.

## Desktop
- Add diagnostics mode for release builds (optional devtools/logging).
- Avoid vendor chunk cycles that could break WebKitGTK on Linux.
- Keep sync disabled by default until a backend is configured.

## Core / Database
- Guard project order index creation when older schemas lack `orderNum`.
- Migrate contentless FTS triggers to proper delete semantics and rebuild flow.

## Docs / CI
- Set Winget install location metadata for successful submissions.
- Update wiki install guidance (Winget/Scoop).
