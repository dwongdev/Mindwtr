# Mindwtr 0.6.0

## Highlights
- Sync safety improvements with better conflict visibility, timestamp normalization logging, and safer write coalescing.
- Desktop UX polish: toast notifications, unsaved edit warnings, and clearer loading/disabled states during project and bulk actions.
- Core performance upgrades, including paginated SQLite loads and safer FTS rebuild locking.

## Desktop
- Add toast notifications for key actions.
- Warn before navigating away with unsaved task edits.
- Improve accessibility for alerts and icon-only controls.
- Show loading state while fetching, and disable create/delete/bulk actions while running.
- Disable attachment controls while uploads are in progress.

## Mobile
- Sync theme settings with core settings.
- Improve logging consistency and typing for sync/storage errors.

## Core & Sync
- Prevent sync write coalescing from losing concurrent changes.
- Validate task and project creation inputs.
- Log timestamp normalization details during sync merges.
- Share sync HTTP helpers across backends.
- Guard FTS rebuilds with a lock and reuse project order cache.
- Page SQLite loads for improved performance.

## Cloud
- Prune rate-limit cache entries to prevent unbounded growth.
- Use structured logging across servers.

## Docs & Dev
- Add architecture diagram and expand CLI/API/MCP documentation.
- Add a task utils benchmark and rapid edit snapshot test.
