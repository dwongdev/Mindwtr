# Mindwtr 0.6.9

## Highlights
- Added mobile notifications for scheduled task times and project/task review times, following the same reliable pipeline as daily/weekly reminders.
- Notification taps now route users to the correct destination (Focus, project page, or related task context) more consistently.
- Added optional Pomodoro Focus timer on desktop and mobile, disabled by default to keep Focus view distraction-free.

## Mobile
- Search now opens completed-task results in the Done list instead of incorrectly jumping to Focus.
- Archived navigation icon is now distinct from Done.
- Fixed iOS quick-add keyboard/input spacing gap.
- Fixed audio attachment replay so tapping play after completion starts playback again.
- Improved iOS back/dismiss behavior by relying on native swipe-down modal dismissal flow.
- Updated iOS splash setup so configured splash sizing is applied correctly.

## Desktop
- Improved Linux update download robustness across distribution paths.

## Release & Distribution
- Added and hardened Mac App Store packaging/signing workflow.
- Added iOS App Store release workflow with Xcode 26 SDK support.
- iOS CI now resolves build numbers from local + App Store Connect max values to avoid duplicate upload failures.
