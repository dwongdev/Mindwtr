# Mindwtr 0.6.22

## Highlights
- Improved Android widget readability and sizing: default 3 tasks, adaptive task count on larger widgets, and less clipping.
- Smoothed Android startup by removing the transient `index` route flash during app launch.
- Improved iOS file sync setup when cloud providers do not expose folder picking.
- Hardened sync and cloud auth reliability across platforms.

## Mobile
- Android widget now adapts visible task count to widget height while keeping rows single-line.
- Android startup transition is cleaner with reduced launch flicker.
- iOS file sync now falls back to selecting an existing JSON file in the target folder when folder providers are unavailable.
- Fixed quick-capture and startup edge cases reported on older Android devices.

## Desktop
- Waiting/follow-up flow now uses review date with a date picker.
- Task editor modal accessibility improved (focus trap + Escape close).
- Search shortcut hints are now platform-specific (`Cmd` on macOS, `Ctrl` elsewhere).
- Fixed Windows Store startup regression.

## Sync & Cloud
- Added retry flow for pending remote writes after failures.
- Added attachment validation guardrails before remote sanitization.
- Hardened cloud bearer token auth and failed-auth throttling.
- Improved missing task/project update error surfacing.

## Build & Release
- FOSS Android release workflow now matches the reproducible recipe used in issue #206 (including pinned Node tarball + checksum).
- Added a unified workspace test command in the repo scripts.
