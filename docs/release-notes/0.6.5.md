# Mindwtr 0.6.5

## Highlights
- Settings sync options for theme, language/date format, external calendar URLs, and AI settings.
- Sidebar sync status with last sync time plus online/offline indicator.
- Quick-add supports Unicode context and tag names.
- Sync reliability and performance improvements.

## Desktop
- Sync history is folded by default and last sync status uses localized labels.
- Cleaner Projects/Board layouts plus a loading skeleton during view transitions.
- Sync errors now use toasts instead of blocking alerts.

## Mobile
- Fix notification trigger scheduling and guard RNFS usage.
- Disable widget tap-to-complete to avoid accidental completions.
- Sync settings UI reordered with sync options folded by default.

## Core & Data
- Guard invalid completion dates in recurrence handling.
- Unicode quick-add parsing for tags/contexts (with test coverage).
- Faster SQLite paging and derived-state caching improvements.
- Initialize empty data on first cloud sync.
