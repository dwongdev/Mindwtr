- Run: `bun desktop:web` | Build: `bun desktop:web:build`

- ✅ Desktop + Mobile sync to cloud backend
- Run: `bun run --filter mindwtr-cloud dev -- --port 8787`

### ✅ Integrations & Automation
**Goal:** Enable power users to automate capture and review.

- ✅ **CLI** (`scripts/mindwtr-cli.ts`): add, list, complete, search
- ✅ **Local REST API** (`scripts/mindwtr-api.ts`): Full CRUD for tasks/projects
- Run CLI: `bun mindwtr:cli -- add "Task title @context"`
- Run API: `bun mindwtr:api -- --port 4317`

### 🔜 Android Widget
**Goal:** Surface agenda on home screen.

- Placeholder stub added (`apps/mobile/lib/widget-service.ts`)

## 🔜 Phase 6 — Calendar Integration (Hard + Soft Landscape)

**Goal:** Show external calendar events as read-only “Hard Landscape” and let users schedule existing tasks (“Soft Landscape”) into free time.

- **Core**
  - Clarify semantics: `dueDate` = deadline; `startTime` = tickler/scheduled start; `timeEstimate` = duration hint.
  - Helpers for day planning (group by day, compute blocks, conflict detection).
- **Desktop**
  - Day + 3‑day timeline views with drag scheduling.
  - External calendar overlays (gray blocks) with refresh/status.
- **Mobile**
  - Day + 3‑day views (initially pick-time scheduling; drag later).
  - Settings UI to connect calendars and control refresh.
