# Pomodoro Focus

Mindwtr includes an optional Pomodoro timer panel in the **Focus** view on desktop and mobile.

By default, this feature is **off** to keep Focus minimal and distraction-free.

## How It Works

- Pick one task from your current Focus candidates.
- Choose a preset:
  - `15/3`
  - `25/5`
  - `50/10`
- Start your focus session.
- When focus ends, Mindwtr switches to break.
- When break ends, it switches back to focus.

Controls:
- **Start/Pause**
- **Reset**
- **Switch phase**
- **Mark done** (completes the selected task)

## Notes

- Pomodoro is task-linked in Focus, so you always know what you are working on.
- The panel is intentionally opt-in so users who prefer a clean GTD Focus page can keep it hidden.
