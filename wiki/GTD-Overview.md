# GTD Overview

Getting Things Done (GTD) is a personal productivity methodology created by David Allen, described in his book *Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity*.

## Mind Like Water

GTD's core philosophy is achieving a state of **mental clarity** where your mind is free from the burden of remembering what needs to be done.

> *"Your head is for having ideas, not holding them."* — David Allen

When your mind trusts that everything is captured in a reliable system, it can focus on actually doing work creatively and effectively.

## The Five Steps

GTD consists of five interconnected steps:

### 1. Capture

Get everything out of your head into a trusted system.

- Write down every task, idea, commitment, or reminder
- Don't filter or organize yet—just capture
- Use the **Inbox** as your landing zone

### 2. Clarify

Process each captured item and decide what it means.

For each item, ask:
- **What is it?**
- **Is it actionable?**
  - No → Trash, Someday/Maybe, or Reference
  - Yes → What's the desired outcome? What's the next action?

### 3. Organize

Put things where they belong:

| Destination       | When to Use                         |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Next Actions**  | Actionable tasks you'll do yourself |
| **Projects**      | Outcomes requiring multiple actions |
| **Waiting For**   | Delegated to someone else           |
| **Calendar**      | Must happen at a specific time      |
| **Someday/Maybe** | Ideas for the future                |
| **Reference**     | Information to keep (notes)         |
| **Trash**         | Not needed                          |

### 4. Reflect

Review your system regularly.

- **Daily review** — Scan your lists, calendar, and inbox
- **Weekly review** — Comprehensive review of all lists, clear inboxes, update projects

### 5. Engage

Take action with confidence.

Choose what to work on based on:
- **Context** — Where are you? What tools do you have?
- **Time** — How much time do you have?
- **Energy** — What's your mental/physical state?
- **Priority** — What matters most?

## Key Concepts

### Next Actions

A next action is the **next visible, physical activity** to move something forward.

❌ Bad: "Work on project"
✓ Good: "Open project folder and review status notes"

### Projects

A project is any outcome requiring more than one action. It's a commitment to a result, not a to-do list.

### Areas, Projects, and Tasks

Mindwtr uses a flexible "container" model so you can organize without friction:

- **Areas** are ongoing responsibilities (e.g., Work, Home, Health).  
- **Projects** are outcomes with an end. They can live inside an Area *or* stand alone.  
- **Tasks** can live inside a Project, inside an Area directly, or be completely unassigned (Inbox / no Area).

This lets you keep long‑running responsibilities in Areas while still capturing quick tasks without forcing a folder choice.

### The 2-Minute Rule

If an action takes less than 2 minutes, **do it immediately** during processing.

### Contexts

Tags that indicate where or with what you can do something:
- `@home`, `@work`, `@errands`
- `@computer`, `@phone`
- `#focused`, `#lowenergy`

## Why GTD Works

1. **External trusted system** — Your brain stops trying to remember
2. **Clear next actions** — No ambiguity about what to do
3. **Regular reviews** — System stays current and trusted
4. **Context-based lists** — See only what's relevant right now

## Learning GTD

- **6 months** — Stop feeling clumsy with the system
- **1-2 years** — Truly internalize the principles
- **Ongoing** — Re-reading reveals new insights
